class NocapsEvaluator(object):
    r"""
    A utility class to submit model predictions on nocaps splits to EvalAI, and retrieve model
    performance based on captioning metrics (such as CIDEr, SPICE).

    Extended Summary
    ----------------
    This class and the training script together serve as a working example for "EvalAI in the
    loop", showing how evaluation can be done remotely on privately held splits. Annotations
    (captions) and evaluation-specific tools (e.g. `coco-caption <https://www.github.com/tylin/coco-caption>`_)
    are not required locally. This enables users to select best checkpoint, perform early
    stopping, learning rate scheduling based on a metric, etc. without actually doing evaluation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    phase: str, optional (default = "val")
        Which phase to evaluate on. One of "val" or "test".

    Notes
    -----
    This class can be used for retrieving metrics on both, val and test splits. However, we
    recommend to avoid using it for test split (at least during training). Number of allowed
    submissions to test split on EvalAI are very less, and can exhaust in a few iterations! However,
    the number of submissions to val split are practically infinite.

    def evaluate(

    ) -> Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]:
        r"""
        Take the model predictions (in COCO format), submit them to EvalAI, and retrieve model
        performance based on captioning metrics.

        Parameters
        ----------
        predictions: List[Prediction]
            Model predictions in COCO format. They are a list of dicts with keys
            ``{"image_id": int, "caption": str}``.
        iteration: int, optional (default = None)
            Training iteration where the checkpoint was evaluated.

        Returns
        -------
        Dict[str, Dict[str, float]]
